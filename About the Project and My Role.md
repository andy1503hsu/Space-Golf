In my junior year of high school, I took Introduction to Java, the first programming class would take. The final project was to — over the course of two months — create a game using Java’s Graphic User Interface. My friend and I teamed up to create “Space Golf,” a golf course in space where the trajectory of the golf ball is dictated by the gravitational forces “generated” by the on-screen planets.

Although we constantly collaborated with each other, I was predominantly responsible for the game’s mechanics, while my friend was in charge of the game’s user interface and menus. At the time, I was also taking AP Physics 1 and had just recently learned about Newton’s Law of Gravitation. I was very eager at the opportunity to implement and apply this law in a completely different class.

Consequently, to achieve this goal, I developed multiple algorithms from scratch. These included:

- A dragging mechanic from the golf ball to the location of the user’s mouse (this would be the ball's initial velocity)
- Calculating the gravitational force vectors each planet exerted on the ball as it traveled through “space”
- Combining these 2-dimensional vectors together to find the net force vector
- Converting this net force vector to acceleration, velocity, and position
- Redrawing the screen every single frame to reflect the change in position
- A collision detection algorithm that would stop the ball’s motion when it came into contact with a planet
- Out of bounds detection that would place the ball back at its “pre-shot” location

By developing, debugging, and testing these algorithms, I was able to significantly sharpen my problem solving skills, as well as my skills as a programmer in general. Because I was able to combine numerous concepts in STEM into one single product and observe how they interacted with one another, I found this project extremely fun and rewarding, in a way I had never felt before. In addition, coding Space Golf deepened my understanding about certain topics unrelated to programming — for example, when writing the algorithms related to vector addition and converting force to position, I developed a more nuanced understanding about trigonometric functions and integral calculus, respectively. And, of course, it was really enjoyable to simply play around with the levels and try to see what interesting trajectories I could find.

Although Space Golf started as a school project, it became the catalyst for me to fully recognize my passion for both aerospace and programming. Now, several years later, it is my dream to work in the field of astrodynamics, where I would be able to combine both of these interests in the same workplace.
