# Space-Golf
A golf course in space!

Programmed in spring of 2018, this game was my friend and I's final project in our Introduction to Java class. For more information about my role, check out [this file](https://github.com/andy1503hsu/Space-Golf/blob/main/About%20the%20Project%20and%20My%20Role.md).

To run the game, make sure to download 6 files (`Game.java`, `HighScores.txt`, and the four pictures) in total.

The main menu should look like this:

Although the obvious goal of the game is to complete the levels, I encourage you to input different velocities and find interesting trajectories on your own! 

Such as a gravity assist:

Or a "Figure 8":

I hope you have fun!
